# Section 1: SEC598.1: Security Automation Concepts

In this lab series, we will leverage Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles to automate the provisioning, configuration, and management of cloud infrastructure. 
By utilizing IaC tools such as Terraform, Ansible, and SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) platforms, we aim to achieve a highly efficient, 
scalable, and secure environment. The labs focus on designing infrastructure that is not only repeatable but also maintains a state-driven approach, ensuring 
consistency across multiple deployments. This automation minimizes manual intervention, enabling teams to deploy infrastructure in minutes and eliminate configuration
drift.

# Section 2: SEC598.2: Security Automation Engineering

Terraform will be used as the primary tool for provisioning and managing cloud resources. We will explore creating and managing cloud infrastructure across 
multiple providers, such as AWS, Azure, and GCP. Each lab will include Terraform modules to provision compute resources (EC2, Azure VMs, GCP instances), 
networking components (VPCs, subnets, security groups), storage services (S3, Azure Storage), and identity management (IAM).

In the initial labs, we will focus on setting up a modular architecture where Terraform modules can be reused across environments. You will also learn how 
to leverage Terraform state files and remote backends, using providers such as AWS S3 and Azure Blob Storage for shared state management. We will implement 
secure methods for storing sensitive data using HashiCorp Vault integration with Terraform, ensuring secure credentials and API keys in production.

# Section 3: SEC598.3: Security Automation in the Cloud

Once the infrastructure is provisioned, Ansible will be employed to configure the underlying operating systems and deploy application-specific configurations. 
We will utilize Ansible playbooks and roles to automate system updates, software installations, and security configurations. These labs will introduce concepts 
such as idempotency in Ansible, ensuring that repeated playbook runs do not alter the desired system state unnecessarily.

You will learn to manage infrastructure at scale using Ansible’s dynamic inventory capabilities, integrating with cloud APIs to automatically detect and 
configure new nodes. Advanced topics will include using Ansible Tower to create workflows for multi-step automation, enhancing scalability, visibility, and 
security in DevOps environments.

# Section 4: SEC598.4: Offensive Security Automation

Security automation plays a crucial role in our DevOps pipeline. We will use SOAR tools to detect and respond to security incidents within cloud environments. 
This includes using Terraform to provision cloud-native security services such as AWS CloudWatch, Azure Sentinel, and GCP Security Command Center. SOAR tools 
will automate threat detection, correlation, and incident response. For instance, AWS Lambda functions, triggered by CloudWatch Events, will remediate security 
vulnerabilities in real-time by modifying misconfigured IAM roles or patching vulnerable instances.

Note for winning a coin in the capstone:  For OnDemand students only, if you wish to earn a challenge coin, follow these steps:
Summary:  Create an automation that is useful to you personally, professionally or that you can use for your company and submit it to the course authors.  
If we evaluate it as worthy, we will award you with a SEC598 coin.  Steps:
1. Using your favorite text editor, document what security or business requirements are for the automation.  State the security or business problem and 
how will the requirements solve it?
2. Code the automation.  At a minimum, it must use something from the class that we learned.  Examples include a python aws lambda system, terraform IaC, 
Azure template spec, Tines story.
3. Using your favorite text editor, describe how the automation meets the security requirements and solves the security or business problem.
4. Submit the text file (capturing 1 and 3) along with the automation code (2) to the course authors via email.  Wait up to 7 days for our analysis and response.

We will also set up security playbooks in SOAR that integrate with Ansible to trigger automated remediation tasks such as disabling compromised user accounts, 
applying firewall rules, or quarantining malicious endpoints.

# Section 5: SEC598.5: Defensive Security Automatoin

A key component of this lab series is the integration of all tools into a Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. Jenkins or GitLab CI 
will be used to automate the end-to-end deployment of infrastructure and applications. This pipeline will integrate with version control systems to trigger 
Terraform and Ansible deployments based on code changes. We will enforce testing and validation, such as infrastructure linting and Ansible syntax checks, to 
ensure stability in production deployments. The labs will conclude with an automated rollback mechanism that leverages Terraform’s state management and Ansible’s 
failure detection, ensuring resilient and reliable automation workflows.
